## 🔑 How to Get a Gemini API Key

The Google Gemini API is essential for the "Analyze Your Sentence" feature to function. To use this interactive capability, you will need to obtain your own API key.

1.  **Visit Google AI Studio:** Go to <https://makersuite.google.com/>.

2.  **Sign in:** Use your Google account to sign in to the platform.

3.  **Create API Key:** On the left-hand sidebar, look for the "Get API Key" option or navigate to the "API Keys" section.

4.  **Generate New Key:** Click on "Create API Key in new project" (if you don't have an existing project) or simply "Create API Key" to generate a new key.

5.  **Copy the Key:** Securely copy the generated API key.

6.  **Integrate (for developers):** If you are running or modifying this code, you will need to insert this API key into the JavaScript code where the API calls are made. Look for a variable (e.g., `const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";`) and replace the placeholder with your copied key.
